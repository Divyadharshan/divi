<p>India reported 1,59,986 fresh COVID-19 cases, over 12 per cent higher than the previous day's cases. The country's daily positivity rate stands at 9.28 per cent while the active cases are 4,72,169.
Delhi's daily Covid cases shot up by 15 per cent on Friday after 17,335 fresh cases were detected in 24 hours.

<br><br>
Several Covid restrictions have been imposed in the national capital as the surge continues. A weekend curfew from 10 pm Friday to 5 am Monday has also been put in place. Only essential services will be allowed during these hours.

Omicron is causing record numbers of cases around the world, and though it causes less severe Covid-19, experts warn this wave still threatens to overwhelm health systems. Six weeks after it was first sequenced in southern Africa Omicron cases are smashing infection records with average new daily cases at nearly two million this week, according to an AFP tally.

The World Health Organization has said that the spread of Omicron was down to a combination of factors including the make-up of the Covid-19 variant and increased social mixing.</p>
